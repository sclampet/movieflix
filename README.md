# Movieflix (WIP)
## Overview
Movieflix a common iOS Developer take-home project example. The basic requirements for the app are to display movie data from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)'s API in a collection view. 

## Why?
My intention here is to give the more jr. ios community, or those looking to interview for a new position, a good example of building out a simple app that is well tested and adhere's to principles like SOLID.

## Specs
You'll find that I've implemented my own HttpClient, Data Store, and services respectively. I'm also not using any 3rd party dependencies. I'm open to any and all feedback!
