# Movieflix (WIP)
[Movieflix](https://github.com/sclampet) a common iOS Developer take-home project I recently completed. The basic requirements for the app are to display movie data from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)'s REST api in a collection view. I'm making sure to build the UI programmatically with as few 3rd party dependencies as possible, and with as much test coverage as I can muster.

Check out the commit history for udpates on my progress and for a deeper look into what my approach looks like!
